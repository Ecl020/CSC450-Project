# Dijstra's and Distance Vector Algorithm Instructions

How to use this program.
- When attempting to execute the program, python *filename*.py, you want to add one more argument after the initial command. The first argument is the file name and the second argument will be the starting point for both algorithms. Both algorithms will run and output the shortest path.

- The Topology file is the file that holds the matrix. To add your own matrix, simply just change or make a new file to give the script.
